  "invention_title": "Real-time Image Enhancement during Pixel Format Conversion",
  "inventors": ["Your Name(s)"],
  "description": "A method and system for performing real-time image enhancement during the conversion of images between different pixel formats.",
  "background": "USB cameras capture images in various pixel formats requiring conversion to a common format like RGB. Existing methods focus solely on conversion without simultaneous enhancement.",
  "invention": "Integrates image enhancement techniques into the pixel format conversion process, improving image quality in real-time without additional processing steps.",
  "technical_implementation": {
    "input_image": "An image is received in a source pixel format (e.g., YUYV).",
    "conversion_with_enhancement": [
      "The image is converted to the target pixel format (e.g., RGB) using established algorithms.",
      "During conversion, image enhancement algorithms are applied to improve specific aspects, such as noise reduction, color correction, low-light enhancement, or sharpening.",
      "Enhancement techniques are selected based on source format, target format, and desired image characteristics."
    ],
    "output_image": "The enhanced image is output in the target pixel format."
  },
  "advantages": [
    "Real-time enhancement without adding latency or separate processing steps.",
    "Efficient use of computational resources by integrating enhancement into conversion.",
    "Flexibility to apply different enhancement techniques based on specific needs.",
    "Improved image quality for subsequent processing, analysis, or display."
  ],
  "potential_applications": [
    "Robotics: Enhance images for navigation, object recognition, and manipulation.",
    "Computer Vision: Preprocess images for object detection, tracking, and classification.", 
    "Medical Imaging: Improve image quality for diagnosis and analysis.",
    "Consumer Electronics: Enhance images and videos captured by smartphones, webcams, or other devices."

  "patent_claims": [
    {
      "claim_number": 1,
      "claim_text": "A method for enhancing an image during pixel format conversion, comprising: receiving an image in a source pixel format; converting the image to a target pixel format; and applying at least one image enhancement technique to the image during the conversion process."
    },
    {
      "claim_number": 2,
      "claim_text": "A system for enhancing an image during pixel format conversion, comprising: means for receiving an image in a source pixel format; means for converting the image to a target pixel format; and means for applying at least one image enhancement technique to the image during the conversion process."
    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": [
    "Implementation can be in software, hardware, or a combination of both.",
    "Enhancement techniques are adaptable to different image sensors and camera types.",
    "System can be integrated into various image processing pipelines."
